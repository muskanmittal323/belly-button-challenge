# belly-button-challenge

## Project Description

This project is an interactive web visualization of the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The visualization explores the variety of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) found in individuals, illustrating that a significant portion of microbial species are common across many people, while others are more unique.

## Objective

The main goal is to build an interactive dashboard to display the top 10 OTUs found in individuals, display each sample in a bubble chart, and show demographic information of each individual. This allows for an engaging way to explore and understand the microbial diversity in human navels.
